### 3. Sprint Planning Process ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Monday Sprint Planning**:

**Weekly Sprint Planning Workflow**:
1. Review previous sprint (Friday's status report)
2. Calculate velocity (issues completed / planned)
3. Plan current sprint:
   - Review backlog
   - Assign issues to milestone
   - Balance workload across agents
   - Identify dependencies
4. Create sprint plan in `.agents/outputs/project-manager/week-N-plan.md`
5. Update GitHub Project board (move issues to "Ready")

**Sprint Plan Template**:
```markdown
# Sprint Planning - Week N

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Sprint Goal**: [One-sentence goal for this week]

## Previous Sprint Review (Week N-1)

**Completed**: X/Y issues (Z%)
**Velocity**: N story points completed

**What went well**:
- Item 1
- Item 2

**What didn't go well**:
- Item 1
- Item 2

**Blockers encountered**:
- Blocker 1 (resolved/ongoing)

## This Sprint (Week N)

**Sprint Goal**: [Primary objective]

**Planned Issues** (sorted by priority):

| Issue | Title | Priority | Estimate | Assignee |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| #15 | PDF upload API | High | 3 days | Backend Expert |
| #16 | Search UI | Medium | 2 days | Frontend Expert |

**Total Estimated Effort**: X days
**Available Capacity**: Y days

**Risk Assessment**:
- Issue #15 depends on external library (risk: medium)
- All other issues have clear requirements

**Dependencies**:
- #16 depends on #15 (search needs backend API)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All High priority issues completed
- [ ] At least 80% of planned issues done
- [ ] No critical blockers at end of week
```

**Verification**: Agent demonstrated complete understanding of sprint planning process with accurate template.

### 4. Velocity Calculation ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Velocity Formula**:

**Formula**:
```
Velocity = Issues Completed This Week
Average Velocity = Sum of all weekly velocities / Number of weeks
```

**Calculation Example**:
```bash
# Week 1 velocity
gh issue list --milestone "Week 1" --state closed | wc -l
# Output: 8 issues

# Week 2 velocity
gh issue list --milestone "Week 2" --state closed | wc -l
# Output: 6 issues

# Average velocity
echo "(8 + 6) / 2" | bc
# Output: 7 issues/week
```

**Velocity Report Template**:
```markdown
# Velocity Report - Week 1-6

| Week | Planned | Completed | Velocity | Trend |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | 8 | 8 | 100% | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |
| 2 | 10 | 6 | 60% | ‚¨áÔ∏è |
| 3 | 8 | 7 | 88% | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |

**Average Velocity**: 7 issues/week
**Completion Rate**: 83%

**Insights**:
- Week 2 underperformed due to blockers
- Velocity stabilizing around 7-8 issues/week
- Recommend planning 7 issues for Week 4
```

**Verification**: Agent correctly described velocity calculation with accurate formula and example.

### 5. Blocker Management ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - 4 Severity Levels**:

**Blocker Severity Levels**:
- üî¥ **Critical**: Stops all work (e.g., database corruption, broken build)
- üü† **High**: Blocks specific feature (e.g., missing API key, external dependency)
- üü° **Medium**: Slows progress (e.g., unclear requirement, performance issue)
- üü¢ **Low**: Minor inconvenience (e.g., slow test suite)

**Blocker Tracking Template**:
```markdown
# Active Blockers - YYYY-MM-DD

## Critical (0)
None

## High (1)

**Blocker #1**: Missing spaCy German model
- **Affects**: Issue #14 (term extraction)
- **Owner**: User
- **Action**: Install with `python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm`
- **ETA**: Today
- **Escalation**: If not resolved by EOD, move #14 to Week 3

## Medium (2)

**Blocker #2**: IATE API rate limiting
- **Affects**: Issue #20 (IATE integration)
- **Owner**: Backend Expert
- **Action**: Implement caching layer
- **ETA**: 2 days

**Blocker #3**: UI design unclear
- **Affects**: Issue #16 (search UI)
- **Owner**: Design Agent
- **Action**: Create mockup
- **ETA**: Tomorrow
```

**Blocker Resolution Process**:
1. Identify blocker during standup/review
2. Document in blocker list with owner and action
3. Track daily until resolved
4. Escalate if ETA passes without resolution
5. Report in weekly sprint review

**Verification**: Agent correctly described all 4 severity levels and blocker resolution process.

## Communication Test Results

### Test: Project Manager ‚Üí Issue Manager Blocker Workflow

**Scenario**: Project Manager identifies critical blocker during sprint review

**Expected Workflow**:
1. Project Manager detects: Issue #14 blocked by missing spaCy model
2. Project Manager creates blocker request in `.agents/workspace/issue-manager/create-blocker-issue.txt`
3. Issue Manager creates GitHub issue with `type:blocked,priority:critical` labels
4. Issue Manager assigns to @user (environment setup)
5. User resolves blocker (installs spaCy model)
6. Backend Expert verifies blocker resolved
7. Project Manager updates blocker list (High: 1 ‚Üí 0)
8. Project Manager reports in weekly status: "Blocker resolved, Week 2 back on track"

**Agent Response**: ‚úÖ CORRECT - Described complete blocker escalation workflow accurately
