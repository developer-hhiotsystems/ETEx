```

**Verification**: Agent correctly described complete test report format.

---

### 5. Failure Workflow ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - When Tests Fail**:

**Workflow**:
1. Testing agent runs test suite
2. Tests fail OR coverage <80%
3. Testing agent creates detailed failure report in `.agents/outputs/testing/`
4. Testing agent creates issue request in `.agents/workspace/issue-manager/create-issue-NNN.txt`
5. Issue Manager creates GitHub issue with:
   - Label: `type:bug,priority:high`
   - Assigned to: Coding Agent (or Backend/Frontend Expert)
   - Body: Link to test report, specific failures
6. Coding agent fixes issues
7. Coding agent commits fixes
8. Testing agent re-runs tests (focused re-test)
9. Testing agent reports: ✅ PASS or ❌ STILL FAILING

**Issue Request Template**:
```
SEVERITY: MAJOR
TITLE: fix: Test failures in term service
LABELS: type:bug,priority:high,component:backend
MILESTONE: Week 2
ASSIGNEE: @backend-expert
BODY:
Test suite failed for term service implementation.

**Test Report**: .agents/outputs/testing/test-report-2025-10-31.md

**Failures**:
1. test_create_term_invalid_source (AssertionError)
2. test_get_term_not_found (HTTPException 500 instead of 404)

**Coverage**: 75% (below 80% threshold)

**Action Required**:
- Fix failing tests
- Increase coverage to ≥80%
- Re-run: `pytest tests/unit/backend/test_term_service.py --cov`
```

**Verification**: Agent correctly described complete failure workflow.

## Communication Test Results

### Test: Coding Agent → Testing Agent → Issue Manager Workflow

**Scenario**: Coding agent completes feature, Testing agent finds failures

**Expected Workflow**:
1. Coding agent commits: `feat(search): Implement search API`
2. Coding agent updates issue: "Implementation complete, ready for review"
3. Testing agent receives handoff, reads code
4. Testing agent runs: `pytest tests/ --cov=src`
5. **Result**: 2 tests fail, coverage 75%
6. Testing agent creates report: `.agents/outputs/testing/test-report-2025-10-31.md`
7. Testing agent creates issue request: `.agents/workspace/issue-manager/create-issue-001.txt`
8. Issue Manager creates GitHub issue #25: "fix: Test failures in search API"
9. Issue Manager assigns to Backend Expert
10. Backend Expert reads test report, fixes failures
11. Backend Expert commits: `fix(search): Handle null query parameter`
12. Backend Expert updates issue: "Fixes applied, ready for re-test"
13. Testing agent re-runs tests: `pytest tests/unit/backend/test_search.py --cov`
14. **Result**: ✅ All tests pass, coverage 85%
15. Testing agent updates issue: "Tests passing, approved for merge"
16. Issue Manager closes issue

**Agent Response**: ✅ CORRECT - Described complete workflow accurately with all 16 steps

---

## Overall Assessment
