## Next Steps - Start Week 1 Development

### Recommended Order of Implementation

**Day 1-2**: Foundation Setup
1. Start with Issue #8 (Dev environment) - Gets tooling ready
2. Then Issue #5 (FastAPI backend) - Creates backend structure
3. Then Issue #4 (Database schema) - Core data models

**Day 2-3**: Frontend Setup
4. Issue #6 (React frontend) - Creates frontend structure
5. Issue #7 (Copy components) - Reuses proven code
6. Issue #10 (Testing setup) - Enables test-driven development

**Day 3**: Verification
7. Issue #9 (Checklist) - Track completion
8. Verify all dev servers running
9. Test database migrations work
10. Confirm Week 1 deliverable met

### Week 1 Deliverable
**Goal**: Empty app with database schema and dev servers running

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Backend dev server runs on http://localhost:8000
- ‚úÖ Frontend dev server runs on http://localhost:5173
- ‚úÖ Database schema created via Alembic migration
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint returns 200
- ‚úÖ Basic navigation works in frontend
- ‚úÖ All tests pass (even if minimal coverage)

## Agent Workflow Recommendations

### For Issue #4 (Database Schema)
**Agent**: Backend Expert or Design Agent
**Workflow**:
1. Read docs/REQUIREMENTS.md Section 13
2. Reference vendor/glossary-app/src/backend/base_models.py
3. Create SQLAlchemy 2.0 models
4. Generate Alembic migration
5. Write basic CRUD tests

### For Issue #5 (FastAPI Backend)
**Agent**: Backend Expert or Coding Agent
**Workflow**:
1. Create src/backend/ structure
2. Initialize FastAPI app
3. Configure Alembic
4. Add health check endpoint
5. Test with curl/Postman

### For Issue #6 (React Frontend)
**Agent**: Frontend Expert or Coding Agent
**Workflow**:
1. Create src/frontend/ structure
2. Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript
3. Install MUI v5
4. Create basic layout
5. Configure proxy to backend

### For Other Issues
Follow similar agent-appropriate workflows as defined in .agents/ system.

## Verification Commands

Run these to verify setup:

```bash
# Check labels (should show 28)
gh label list --repo developer-hhiotsystems/ETEx | wc -l

# Check milestones (should show 7)
gh api repos/developer-hhiotsystems/ETEx/milestones | grep -c title

# Check Week 1 issues (should show 7)
gh issue list --repo developer-hhiotsystems/ETEx --milestone "Week 1"

# Check all open issues
gh issue list --repo developer-hhiotsystems/ETEx --state open
```

---

## Known Issues

1. **Test Issue #3**: Still open (token lacks close permission). You can close it manually in GitHub.
2. **Label Typo**: `tatus: review` should be `status: review`. Fix manually if needed.
3. **GitHub Token Permissions**: Limited to read + create issues. Cannot modify labels/milestones/close issues via API.

### If You Want Full Automation Later

Update GitHub token with these scopes:
- ‚úÖ `repo` (full control)
- ‚úÖ `workflow`
- ‚úÖ `admin:org` (if using organization)
- ‚úÖ `project` (manage projects)

Then update in `.claude/settings.local.json`
