# Design Agent - Integration Test Report

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Test Type**: Project Organization Understanding Verification
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

---

## Test Objectives

Verify that Design Agent understands:
1. CLAUDE.md location and workspace structure
2. Feature specification requirements
3. ADR creation criteria
4. Code reuse research process
5. Handoff to Coding Agent

---

## Test Results

### 1. CLAUDE.md Location ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding**:
- CLAUDE.md located at: `.agents/design/CLAUDE.md`
- Workspace for drafts: `.agents/workspace/design/`
- Final specs location: `docs/architecture/`
- ADRs location: `docs/adr/`

**Verification**: Agent correctly identified all four locations.

---

### 2. Feature Specification Requirements ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Required Sections**:

Every feature spec MUST include:

1. **Feature Overview**
   - Problem statement
   - Acceptance criteria
   - User stories (if applicable)

2. **Database Schema**
   - Table definitions with all columns
   - Foreign key constraints with CASCADE rules
   - Indexes for performance
   - Example data

3. **API Contracts**
   - Endpoint definitions (method, path, parameters)
   - Request/response examples with actual JSON
   - HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
   - Authentication requirements

4. **Security Requirements**
   - Input validation rules
   - Authentication/authorization checks
   - XSS prevention strategy
   - SQL injection prevention (use ORM)

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test scope
   - Integration test scope
   - E2E test scope (if applicable)
   - Edge cases to cover

**Verification**: Agent listed all 5 required sections with accurate details.

---

### 3. Code Reuse Research Process ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Research Workflow**:

**Before designing any feature**:
1. Search `vendor/glossary-app/` for similar features
2. Document what's reusable in spec under "Reusable Components" section
3. Classify components by tier:
   - **Tier 1**: Import directly (no modifications)
   - **Tier 2**: Copy with attribution (modifications needed)
   - **Tier 3**: Reference only (inspiration)

**Example Search Commands**:
```bash
# Search for PDF processing
ls vendor/glossary-app/src/backend/services/
find vendor/glossary-app/ -name "*pdf*"

# Search for term extraction
grep -r "term_extractor" vendor/glossary-app/
```

**Verification**: Agent correctly described complete research workflow with appropriate commands.

---

### 4. ADR Creation Criteria ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - When to Create ADR**:

**Always create ADR for**:
- Technology stack choices (FastAPI vs Flask, SQLite vs PostgreSQL)
- Major architectural decisions (monolith vs microservices)
- Security approach decisions (JWT vs sessions)
- Database schema major changes (new tables, schema refactoring)
- API design patterns (REST vs GraphQL, versioning strategy)

**ADR Template Location**: `docs/adr/template.md`

**ADR Naming Convention**: `NNNN-short-description.md` (e.g., `0002-use-fastapi-file-upload.md`)

**ADR Process**:
1. Copy template: `cp docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/NNNN-my-decision.md`
2. Fill sections: Context, Decision, Consequences
3. Commit with spec: `git add docs/adr/NNNN-*.md`

**Verification**: Agent demonstrated complete understanding of ADR creation process and criteria.

---

### 5. Quality Checklist ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Before Marking Design Complete**:

```markdown
Design Quality Checklist:
- [ ] Specification is implementation-ready (no ambiguity)
- [ ] API contracts have example requests/responses
- [ ] Database schema includes constraints, indexes, foreign keys
- [ ] Security requirements explicit (auth, validation, XSS)
- [ ] Testing strategy defined (unit/integration/e2e scope)
- [ ] Reusable components from vendor/ identified
- [ ] Error handling specified (errors, HTTP codes, messages)
```

**Verification**: Agent listed all 7 checklist items correctly.

---

### 6. Handoff to Coding Agent ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Handoff Process**:

**Steps**:
1. Move final spec from `.agents/workspace/design/` to `docs/architecture/`
2. Create ADR if major decision (move to `docs/adr/`)
3. Commit with message:
   ```
   docs: Add [feature name] specification

   - API endpoints defined
   - Database schema finalized
   - Security requirements specified
   - Ready for implementation
   ```
4. Update GitHub Issue: "Design complete, ready for coding"
5. Assign issue to Coding Agent (or Backend/Frontend Expert)

**Coding Agent Reads**:
- Spec from `docs/architecture/feature-XXX-spec.md`
- Related ADRs from `docs/adr/`
- Implements exactly per spec (no assumptions)

**Verification**: Agent correctly described complete handoff workflow.

---

### 7. ETEx-Specific Requirements ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding**:

**Database Schema Design**:
- Must reference REQUIREMENTS.md section 13 for authoritative schema
- All timestamps (created_at, updated_at) auto-managed
- Foreign keys MUST have CASCADE delete
- Performance indexes on search/filter columns

**API Design**:
- FastAPI with Pydantic models for validation
- Async/await patterns for I/O operations
- OpenAPI documentation generated automatically
- Follow REST conventions (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)

**Reuse Strategy**:
- Check `vendor/glossary-app/` FIRST before designing new components
- Document in spec which components are Tier 1/2/3
- Prefer Tier 1 (import) over Tier 2 (copy)

**Verification**: Agent demonstrated understanding of ETEx-specific design patterns.

## Communication Test Results

### Test: Design Agent → Coding Agent Handoff

**Scenario**: Design agent completes PDF upload feature specification

**Expected Workflow**:
1. Design agent creates comprehensive spec in `.agents/workspace/design/feature-001-pdf-upload-spec.md`
2. Runs through quality checklist (all items checked)
3. Moves spec to `docs/architecture/feature-001-pdf-upload-spec.md`
4. Creates ADR: `docs/adr/0002-use-fastapi-file-upload.md`
5. Commits both files with descriptive message
6. Updates GitHub Issue #10: "Design complete, ready for coding"
7. Assigns issue to Backend Expert agent
8. Coding agent reads spec, implements exactly as designed

**Agent Response**: ✅ CORRECT - Described complete handoff workflow accurately

---

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED ALL TESTS

**Strengths**:
- Complete understanding of 5 required spec sections
- Correct ADR creation criteria and process
- Accurate code reuse research workflow
- Proper quality checklist before handoff
- Understanding of ETEx database schema requirements

**Gaps Identified**: None

**Recommendations**: None - Agent is ready for production use
