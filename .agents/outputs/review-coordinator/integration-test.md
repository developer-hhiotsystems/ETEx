**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Test Type**: Project Organization Understanding Verification
**Status**: ‚úÖ PASSED

---

## Test Objectives

Verify that Review Coordinator agent understands:
1. CLAUDE.md location and instructions
2. Mandatory activation triggers
3. Scripts compliance verification process
4. Severity levels (CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR)
5. Communication with Issue Manager

---

## Test Results

### 1. CLAUDE.md Location ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding**:
- CLAUDE.md located at: `.agents/review-coordinator/CLAUDE.md`
- Workspace for reviews: `.agents/workspace/review-coordinator/`
- Outputs for reports: `.agents/outputs/review-coordinator/`

**Verification**: Agent correctly identified all locations.

---

### 2. Mandatory Activation Triggers ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding**:

**ALWAYS Required Before Commit**:
1. Any modification to `CLAUDE.md` (root or agent-specific)
2. Any modification to `scripts/` directory
3. Any modification to agent CLAUDE.md files (`.agents/*/CLAUDE.md`)

**Recommended**:
- Before committing major refactors
- When uncertain about code quality

**Verification**: Agent correctly identified mandatory vs. recommended triggers.

---

### 3. Scripts Compliance Verification ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Mandatory Rules**:

**Rule 1**: Each script MUST be in own subfolder with dedicated README.md
```
scripts/<category>/<script-name>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <script-name>.ps1
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

**Rule 2**: Category folder README.md MUST list all scripts with descriptions

**Rule 3**: NO .ps1 files directly in category root

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Check for violations
find scripts/ -name "*.ps1" -type f

# Should only find scripts in subfolders:
# scripts/dev/github/create-labels/create-labels.ps1 ‚úÖ
# scripts/dev/github/create-labels.ps1 ‚ùå VIOLATION
```

**Verification**: Agent demonstrated complete understanding of scripts organization rules and verification commands.

---

### 4. Severity Levels ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding**:

**CRITICAL** (üî¥):
- Broken functionality
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risk
- Scripts organization violations
- **Action**: MUST fix before commit, create blocking issue

**MAJOR** (üü†):
- Code quality issues
- Performance problems
- Missing tests
- Incomplete documentation
- **Action**: Should fix before commit, create issue

**MINOR** (üü°):
- Code style inconsistencies
- Minor optimizations
- Typos in comments
- **Action**: Optional fix, create issue if pattern

**Verification**: Agent correctly described all three severity levels with appropriate examples.

---

### 5. CLAUDE.md Review Process ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Review Checklist**:

```markdown
CLAUDE.md Review Checklist:
- [ ] No contradictory rules
- [ ] Rules are actionable (clear, specific)
- [ ] Formatting consistent (headings, code blocks)
- [ ] Examples provided for complex rules
- [ ] Cross-references valid (file paths exist)
- [ ] New rules don't override mandatory workflows
```

**Verification Method**:
1. Read entire CLAUDE.md
2. Check for contradictions (search for conflicting statements)
3. Verify all file paths referenced exist
4. Ensure new rules align with root CLAUDE.md

**Verification**: Agent described comprehensive review process accurately.

---

### 6. Communication with Issue Manager ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Issue Request Format**:

**File**: `.agents/workspace/issue-manager/create-issue-NNN.txt`

**Content Template**:
```
SEVERITY: CRITICAL
TITLE: blocked: Scripts organization violation in dev/github/
LABELS: type:blocked,priority:critical,component:scripts
MILESTONE: Week 1
ASSIGNEE: @user
BODY:
Found scripts compliance violation during review.

**Problem**: Multiple .ps1 files in scripts/dev/github/ root folder
**Violation**: Rule "Each script MUST be in own subfolder"
**Files**:
- scripts/dev/github/create-labels.ps1
- scripts/dev/github/create-milestones.ps1

**Required Fix**:
Move each script to subfolder with dedicated README.md
```

**Verification**: Agent correctly described complete issue request format.

---

### 7. ETEx-Specific Compliance ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding**:

**Scripts Structure Enforcement**:
- Actively verify no .ps1 in category root using `find` command
- Check each script subfolder has README.md
- Verify category README lists all scripts
- Enforcement: CRITICAL severity if violated

**CLAUDE.md Consistency**:
- Root CLAUDE.md is source of truth
- Agent CLAUDE.md must not contradict root
- Path references must use `.agents/` (not `.agent/`)
- Enforcement: MAJOR severity if inconsistent

**Verification**: Agent demonstrated understanding of ETEx-specific compliance rules.

## Communication Test Results

### Test: Review Coordinator ‚Üí Issue Manager Workflow

**Scenario**: Scripts violation found during CLAUDE.md commit review

**Expected Workflow**:
1. Review Coordinator runs `find scripts/ -name "*.ps1"`
2. Finds violation: `scripts/dev/github/create-labels.ps1` (in category root)
3. Creates `.agents/workspace/issue-manager/create-issue-001.txt` with CRITICAL severity
4. BLOCKS commit until issue resolved
5. Issue Manager creates GitHub issue
6. User fixes violation
7. Review Coordinator verifies fix
8. Approves commit

**Agent Response**: ‚úÖ CORRECT - Described complete blocking workflow accurately

---

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASSED ALL TESTS

**Strengths**:
- Complete understanding of mandatory activation triggers
- Correct scripts compliance verification commands
- Accurate severity level assignment (CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR)
- Proper communication protocol with Issue Manager
- Understanding of blocking vs. non-blocking issues

**Gaps Identified**: None
