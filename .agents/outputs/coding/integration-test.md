# Coding Agent - Integration Test Report

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Test Type**: Project Organization Understanding Verification
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

---

## Test Objectives

Verify that Coding Agent understands:
1. CLAUDE.md location and workspace structure
2. 3 tiers of code reuse (vendor/glossary-app)
3. Attribution requirements for copied code
4. 80%+ test coverage target
5. Handoff from Design and to Testing agents

---

## Test Results

### 1. CLAUDE.md Location ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding**:
- CLAUDE.md located at: root `CLAUDE.md` (Coding Role section)
- Workspace for work-in-progress: `.agents/workspace/coding/`
- Final code location: `src/`
- Tests location: `tests/`

**Verification**: Agent correctly identified all four locations.

---

### 2. Code Reuse - 3 Tiers ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding**:

**Tier 1: Import Directly** (PREFERRED)
```python
# No modifications needed - import as-is
from vendor.glossary_app.src.backend.services.pdf_extractor import PDFExtractor

class DocumentProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pdf_extractor = PDFExtractor()  # Direct usage

    def process_upload(self, file_path):
        return self.pdf_extractor.extract(file_path)
```

**When to use**: Code works as-is, no ETEx-specific modifications needed

---

**Tier 2: Copy with Attribution** (when modifications needed)
```python
"""
Adapted from Glossary APP (2025-10-31)
Original: vendor/glossary-app/src/backend/services/term_extractor.py
Modifications:
- Added IEC Electropedia specific term patterns
- Modified clean_term() to handle German compound nouns
- Added support for multilingual term extraction
"""

class TermExtractor:
    # ... implementation with modifications ...
```

**When to use**: Need to modify code for ETEx-specific requirements

---

**Tier 3: Reference Only** (inspiration)
- Read code in vendor/ for patterns and approaches
- Document learnings in `docs/reference/`
- Write new implementation from scratch
- Reference in comments: "Inspired by Glossary APP's approach to X"

**When to use**: Code structure is different, but concepts are useful

---

**Verification**: Agent correctly described all 3 tiers with accurate examples.

---

### 3. Attribution Requirements ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Tier 2 Attribution Template**:

```python
"""
Adapted from Glossary APP (YYYY-MM-DD)
Original: vendor/glossary-app/path/to/original/file.py
Modifications:
- Modification 1 (brief description)
- Modification 2 (brief description)
- Modification 3 (brief description)
"""

# ... copied and modified code ...
```

**Required Elements**:
1. ✅ "Adapted from Glossary APP" header
2. ✅ Date of adaptation (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. ✅ Original file path in vendor/
4. ✅ Bulleted list of specific modifications made

**Verification**: Agent correctly described complete attribution requirements.

---

### 4. Test Coverage Target ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding**:

**Coverage Target**: ≥80% code coverage

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Run unit tests with coverage
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/

# Run all tests
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

**Coverage Report Example**:
```
Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
-------------------------------------------------------
src/services/term.py         45      3    93%   67-69
src/api/endpoints.py         32      8    75%   15-22
-------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                       158     23    85%
```

**Quality Checklist - Testing**:
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration)
- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] Edge cases covered (empty input, invalid data, errors)
- [ ] No flaky tests (tests pass consistently)

**Verification**: Agent correctly described test coverage requirements and commands.

---

### 5. Quality Checklist Before Handoff ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Pre-Handoff Checklist**:

```markdown
Quality Checklist (Before marking implementation complete):
- [ ] All spec requirements implemented
- [ ] Code passes linting (flake8, black, pylint for Python / ESLint for TypeScript)
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration)
- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] Attribution headers on all copied code (Tier 2)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Error handling implemented per spec
- [ ] Descriptive git commit message written
```

**Verification**: Agent listed all 8 checklist items correctly.

---

### 6. Implementation Workflow ✅ CONFIRMED

**Agent Understanding - Complete Workflow**:

**1. Preparation Phase**:
- Read spec from `docs/architecture/feature-XXX-spec.md`
- Check `vendor/glossary-app/` for reusable components
- Identify Tier 1 (import) vs Tier 2 (copy) components

**2. Implementation Phase**:
- Write tests first (Test-Driven Development)
- Implement feature according to spec
- Import from vendor/ when possible (Tier 1)
- Copy with attribution when modifications needed (Tier 2)
- Follow spec exactly - if spec is wrong, ask Design Agent to update it

**3. Testing Phase**:
- Run all tests: `pytest tests/ --cov`
- Check test coverage (target: 80%+)
- Manual testing of critical paths
- Fix any issues

**4. Finalize Phase**:
- Run linting: `black src/ tests/` (Python) or `npm run lint` (TypeScript)
- Ensure all tests pass
- Create descriptive commit message
- Update GitHub Issue: "Implementation complete, ready for review"

**Verification**: Agent correctly described all 4 workflow phases.

---

## Communication Test Results

### Test: Design Agent → Coding Agent → Testing Agent Workflow

**Scenario**: Design agent completes PDF upload spec, Coding agent implements

**Expected Workflow**:
1. Design agent finalizes spec in `docs/architecture/feature-pdf-upload-spec.md`
2. Design agent commits spec, updates issue: "Ready for coding"
3. Coding agent reads spec, identifies reusable code in `vendor/glossary-app/`
4. Coding agent finds `pdf_extractor.py` - can use Tier 1 (import directly)
5. Coding agent writes tests first (TDD)
6. Coding agent implements feature with direct import
7. Coding agent runs tests: `pytest tests/ --cov` (85% coverage)
8. Coding agent runs linting: `black src/ tests/`
9. Coding agent commits: `feat(upload): Implement PDF upload API`
10. Coding agent updates issue: "Implementation complete, ready for review"
11. Testing agent runs full test suite, reviews code
12. Testing agent reports: ✅ PASS - all tests passing, coverage 85%

**Agent Response**: ✅ CORRECT - Described complete workflow accurately with all steps

---
