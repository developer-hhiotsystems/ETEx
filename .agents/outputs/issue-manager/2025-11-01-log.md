## Errors/Warnings

### Permission Issue During Issue Creation

**Problem**: Could not apply labels or milestone to issue #11 due to insufficient GitHub token permissions.

**Error Details**:
```
Error: could not add label: 'type: bug' not found
```

**Root Cause**: The GitHub token has read-only access and can only create issues. It cannot:
- Add/modify labels
- Set milestones
- Add comments
- Close issues
- Update issue properties

**Workaround Applied**:
- Issue #11 created successfully with full documentation
- Labels and milestone must be applied manually via GitHub web UI
- User: Please manually add these to issue #11:
  - Labels: `type: bug`, `priority: high`, `component: backend`, `status: blocked`
  - Milestone: `Week 1`

**Permanent Fix Required**:
Follow instructions in issue #11 to update GitHub token with proper OAuth scopes.

## Notes

- This issue is self-documenting - it explains the very problem that prevented proper issue creation
- Issue Manager agent functionality is severely limited until token permissions are fixed
- All future issue operations will require manual label/milestone/comment management
- Priority: HIGH - This should be fixed before proceeding with Week 1 development

## Next Steps

1. User should manually apply labels/milestone to issue #11 via web UI
2. User should follow resolution steps in issue #11 to update token
3. After token updated, test full Issue Manager workflow:
   - Create test issue with labels
   - Add comment to test issue
   - Close test issue
   - Verify all operations succeed
4. Once verified, Issue Manager can operate at full capacity
