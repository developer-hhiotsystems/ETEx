#### 1. GitHub MCP ‚úÖ UNANIMOUS
**Install Command**:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/
```

**Why**:
- 8/8 agents need this
- Issue Manager: Issue lifecycle (create/close/verify)
- Project Manager: Sprint tracking, velocity calculations
- Coding Agent: Update issue status during implementation
- Testing Agent: Auto-create issues for test failures
- Review Coordinator: Post review reports as PR comments

**Expected Impact**: 60-80% reduction in context switching between terminal and GitHub UI

---

#### 2. Sequential Thinking MCP ‚úÖ UNANIMOUS
**Install Command**:
```bash
# Windows
claude mcp add sequential-thinking cmd -- /c npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking

# macOS/Linux
claude mcp add sequential-thinking npx -- -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

**Why**:
- 8/8 agents rated HIGH or CRITICAL
- Design Agent: Structured spec creation
- Backend/Frontend Experts: Architecture decisions
- Project Manager: Sprint planning, risk assessment
- Review Coordinator: Systematic security audits
- Issue Manager: Closure checklist verification

**Expected Impact**: 20-40% improvement in decision quality through structured analysis

---

#### 3. Context7 MCP ‚úÖ STRONG CONSENSUS
**Install Command**:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
# Requires API key from https://context7.com (free tier: 100 requests/day)
```

**Why**:
- 6/8 agents rated HIGH
- Backend Expert (CRITICAL): Latest FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/Pydantic docs
- Frontend Expert (CRITICAL): Latest React 18/MUI v5/TypeScript docs
- Design Agent: Research best practices for specs
- Coding Agent: Verify vendor/ code is current

**Agents That Don't Need**:
- Issue Manager: Doesn't write code
- Project Manager: Not technical implementation role

**Expected Impact**: 30% faster development with current best practices

---

### Tier 2: Install Week 1-2 (Backend Development Phase)

#### 4. Playwright MCP ‚úÖ SPECIALIZED HIGH VALUE
**Install Command**:
```bash
# Standard
claude mcp add playwright npx -- @playwright/mcp@latest

# Windows
claude mcp add playwright cmd -- /c npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

**Why**:
- 5/8 agents need this (Frontend, Testing, Review, Coding, partial Backend)
- Testing Agent (CRITICAL): E2E testing, Week 6 MVP polish
- Frontend Expert (CRITICAL): Component testing, accessibility audits
- Review Coordinator (HIGH): E2E verification
- Coding Agent (HIGH): 80%+ coverage target

**When to Install**: Can wait until Week 5-6 (frontend testing phase)

**Expected Impact**: 50% faster E2E test creation and execution

---

### Tier 3: Install Week 2-3 (API Development Phase)

#### 5. Apidog MCP ‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITIONAL
**Install Command**:
```bash
# After FastAPI generates OpenAPI spec
claude mcp add apidog -- npx -y apidog-mcp-server@latest --oas=http://localhost:8000/openapi.json
```

**Why**:
- 4/8 agents rated MEDIUM-HIGH
- Testing Agent (HIGH): API testing, mock generation
- Frontend Expert (MEDIUM): TypeScript type generation
- Backend Expert (MEDIUM): API spec validation
- Coding Agent (MEDIUM): Validate before Review handoff

**When to Install**: Week 2-3 after FastAPI app is running

**Expected Impact**: Prevents frontend/backend integration issues through type safety

---

### Tier 4: Optional / Agent-Specific

#### 6. DuckDuckGo MCP ‚ö†Ô∏è OPTIONAL
**Install Command**:
```bash
# After cloning MCP servers repo
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers.git
cd servers/src/duckduckgo
npm install

claude mcp add duckduckgo node -- c:/path/to/servers/src/duckduckgo/index.js
```

**Why**:
- 3/8 agents rated MEDIUM (Backend, Frontend, Testing)
- Backend Expert: Error resolution, async edge cases
- Frontend Expert: React error solutions
- Testing Agent: Test failure research

**Why Optional**: Context7 covers most documentation needs

**Expected Impact**: Saves 10-15 minutes per web search, but not critical

---

#### 7. Knowledge Graph Memory MCP ‚ö†Ô∏è CONTROVERSIAL
**Install Command**:
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/server-memory.git
cd server-memory
npm install
npm run build

claude mcp add knowledge-graph node -- c:/path/to/server-memory/build/index.js
```

**Mixed Feedback**:
- ‚úÖ **Support** (4 agents): Issue Manager, Design, Frontend Expert, Coding
- ‚ùå **Oppose** (4 agents): Review Coordinator, Backend Expert, Project Manager, Testing
  - Reason: Encourages bias, redundant with git/GitHub, anti-pattern for stateless work

**Recommendation**: SKIP for MVP. Re-evaluate after Week 3 if context loss is observed.

---

### Tier 5: Do NOT Install

#### 8. Memory Bank MCP ‚ùå REDUNDANT
- Only 2/8 agents rated MEDIUM (Project Manager, Coding)
- Redundant with Knowledge Graph Memory (which itself is controversial)
- **Verdict**: SKIP

#### 9. MCP Compass ‚ùå ONE-TIME UTILITY
- Only 2/8 agents rated MEDIUM (Design, Project Manager)
- One-time discovery tool, no recurring value
- **Verdict**: SKIP (user can manually research MCPs)

## Cost Analysis

| MCP Server | Tier | Cost | Notes |
|------------|------|------|-------|
| GitHub | Free | $0 | Requires GitHub account |
| Sequential Thinking | Free | $0 | Open source |
| Context7 | Free tier | $0 | 100 requests/day (sufficient for MVP) |
| Playwright | Free | $0 | Open source |
| Apidog | Free | $0 | Open source |

---

## Next Steps

1. **User Decision**: Approve final installation list (3 critical + 3 optional)
2. **Install Week 0 MCPs**: GitHub, Sequential Thinking, Context7
3. **Update Agent CLAUDE.md Files**: Add MCP usage sections to all 8 agents
4. **Verify Installation**: Test each MCP with sample commands
5. **Week 1 Start**: Agents begin using MCPs in workflows
6. **Week 3 Review**: Assess if optional MCPs (Apidog, DuckDuckGo) should be added
7. **Week 5 Install**: Add Playwright for E2E testing phase

---

**Compiled By**: Main Agent
**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Recommendation**: Install 3 critical MCPs immediately (GitHub, Sequential Thinking, Context7). Add Playwright in Week 5. Defer/skip Knowledge Graph Memory, Memory Bank, MCP Compass.
