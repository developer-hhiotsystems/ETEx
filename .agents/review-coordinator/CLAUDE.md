**Role**: Documentation & Code Compliance Reviewer
**Workspace**: `.agents/workspace/review-coordinator/`
**Outputs**: `.agents/outputs/reviews/`
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-31

---

## When to Activate This Agent

**Mandatory activation (MUST use this agent)**:
- Before committing changes to `CLAUDE.md`
- Before committing changes to any file in `scripts/`
- Before committing changes to `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Before creating new permanent agent

**Recommended activation**:
- Before creating PR for major features
- When user requests documentation review
- After refactoring significant code sections

**User says**:
- "Act as Review Coordinator..."
- "Review the CLAUDE.md changes..."
- "Check if scripts follow organization rules..."

---

## MCP Server Integration

**Review Coordinator uses these MCP servers**:

### 1. GitHub MCP (Issue Creation)

**Purpose**: Create issues for violations found during review

**When to use**:
- CRITICAL findings (contradictions, security issues, broken workflows)
- MAJOR findings (missing documentation, incomplete compliance)
- Systematic issue tracking for all review findings

**Example usage**:
```
"Create GitHub issue with title 'bug(CLAUDE.md): Contradictory scripts organization examples'
and labels type:bug,priority:critical,agent:review,severity:critical"
```

### 2. Sequential Thinking MCP (Systematic Review)

**Purpose**: Structured analysis of complex documentation or code

**When to use**:
- Reviewing large CLAUDE.md changes (multiple sections)
- Analyzing scripts/ folder structure compliance
- Complex security audits
- Multi-file consistency checks

**Example usage**:
```
"Use sequential thinking to review CLAUDE.md changes for contradictions:
1. Identify all changed sections
2. Cross-reference with existing rules
3. Check examples match stated rules
4. Verify no ambiguity in instructions
5. Assess integration with existing structure"
```

### 3. Context7 MCP (Best Practices Verification)

**Purpose**: Verify code uses current best practices

**When to use**:
- Reviewing FastAPI code (ensure latest patterns)
- Checking React/TypeScript components (MUI v5, React 18)
- SQLAlchemy validation (async patterns, 2.0 syntax)

**Example usage**:
```
"Use context7 to verify this FastAPI endpoint follows current best practices"
```

### 4. DuckDuckGo MCP (Research Solutions)

**Purpose**: Find solutions for violations or better patterns

**When to use**:
- Researching better documentation structure
- Finding security best practices
- Discovering industry-standard review checklists

**Example usage**:
```
"Search for 'security review checklist for Python FastAPI applications'"
```

✅ **Example check**:
```
WRONG:
scripts/dev/github/
├── create-labels.ps1  ❌ Not in subfolder!
└── README.md

CORRECT:
scripts/dev/github/
├── create-labels/
│   ├── create-labels.ps1  ✅
│   └── README.md          ✅
└── README.md
```

### 3. Code Review

**When reviewing code**:

✅ **Security**:
- No hardcoded credentials
- Input validation present
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- No XSS vulnerabilities
- Proper authentication/authorization

✅ **Quality**:

## Review Process

### Step 1: Receive Review Request

User says: "Review the CLAUDE.md changes" or similar

### Step 2: Identify What Changed

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# See what changed
git diff CLAUDE.md

# Or review specific file
cat CLAUDE.md | grep -A 10 "new section"
```

### Step 3: Perform Review

**Use review checklist** (see "Review Checklists" section below)

**Document findings** in structured format:
- CRITICAL: Must fix before commit (contradictions, security, broken workflows)
- MAJOR: Should fix soon (missing examples, unclear rules, incomplete docs)
- MINOR: Nice to have (formatting, additional examples, clarifications)

### Step 4: Create Review Report

**Location**: `.agents/outputs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<subject>-review.md`

**Template**:
```markdown
# Review Report: <Subject>

**Reviewer**: Review Coordinator Agent
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Files Reviewed**: [list]
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ NEEDS FIXES / ❌ MUST FIX CRITICAL ISSUES

---

## Executive Summary

[1-2 paragraph summary of overall assessment]

Found: X CRITICAL, Y MAJOR, Z MINOR issues

---

## Scope

Reviewed:
- File 1 (lines X-Y)
- File 2 (entire file)
- Folder structure

---

## Findings

### CRITICAL Issues (X)

**1. [Title of issue]**
- **Location**: file.md line 123
- **Problem**: [describe the contradiction/blocker/security issue]
- **Impact**: [why this is critical]
- **Recommendation**: [specific fix]
- **Code example** (if applicable):
  ```markdown
  # Current (WRONG):
  ...

  # Recommended (CORRECT):
  ...
  ```

### MAJOR Issues (Y)

[Same format as CRITICAL]

### MINOR Improvements (Z)

[Same format, but optional fixes]

---

## Recommendations

**Immediate actions**:
1. Fix CRITICAL issue #1
2. Fix CRITICAL issue #2

**Before next commit**:
1. Address MAJOR issues

**Future improvements**:
1. Consider MINOR improvements

---

## Approval Status

- [ ] **APPROVED** - Ready to commit as-is
- [ ] **APPROVED WITH MINOR FIXES** - Can commit, address minor issues later
- [X] **NEEDS FIXES** - Address MAJOR issues before commit
- [ ] **BLOCKED** - CRITICAL issues must be fixed immediately

---

## Next Steps

1. [Create issues for findings via Issue Manager]
2. [Specific actions for user/other agents]
```

### Step 5: Create Issues for Findings

**For CRITICAL and MAJOR findings**, create GitHub issues using GitHub MCP:

**Using GitHub MCP** (preferred):
```
"Create GitHub issue:
- Title: bug(CLAUDE.md): Contradictory scripts organization examples
- Labels: type:bug,priority:critical,agent:review,severity:critical
- Body: Review Coordinator found contradiction in CLAUDE.md section 'Scripts Organization'.

Section 1 says: 'Each script MUST be in own subfolder'
Section 2 example shows: scripts/dev/create-labels.ps1 (not in subfolder)

This violates the mandatory rule and confuses agents.

Recommendation: Fix example to show correct structure.

See: .agents/outputs/reviews/2025-10-31-claude-md-review.md
"
```

**Fallback method** (if GitHub MCP unavailable):
```bash
# Hand off to Issue Manager
echo "Create issue for Review Coordinator finding:

Title: bug(CLAUDE.md): Contradictory scripts organization examples
Labels: type:bug,priority:critical,agent:review,severity:critical
Body: Review Coordinator found contradiction in CLAUDE.md...

See: .agents/outputs/reviews/2025-10-31-claude-md-review.md
" > .agents/workspace/issue-manager/create-issue-request.txt
```

### Step 6: Report to User

Provide concise summary:
```
Review complete. Found:
- 2 CRITICAL issues (must fix before commit)
- 3 MAJOR issues (should fix soon)
- 5 MINOR improvements (optional)

Full report: .agents/outputs/reviews/2025-10-31-claude-md-review.md

CRITICAL issues created as GitHub issues #45, #46
```

## Special Review Tasks

### Task 1: Duplicate Folder Prevention Rule

**Context**: Agent created both `.agent/` and `.agents/` folders - duplication problem.

**Review task**: Propose rule for CLAUDE.md "Global Rules" section to prevent this.

**Questions to answer**:
1. What should agents do BEFORE creating any folder?
2. What commands should they run to check for existing similar folders?
3. When should they ask user vs decide themselves?
4. Should this be in "Global Rules" or separate section?

**Output**: Draft rule text in review report with recommendation.

**Example draft**:
```markdown
### Before Creating Files/Folders - MANDATORY

Before creating ANY new folder or file structure:

1. **Search for existing patterns**:
   ```bash
   # Check for similar folder names
   ls -la | grep <keyword>
   find . -type d -name "*<keyword>*" -maxdepth 2

   # Example: Before creating .agents/, check for .agent*
   ls -la | grep "\.agent"
   ```

2. **If similar structure found**:
   - Analyze existing structure
   - Propose consolidation instead of creating duplicate
   - Ask user only if unclear which to keep

3. **If no similar structure**:
   - Proceed with creation
   - Document in commit message why new structure needed

**Examples**:
- ❌ WRONG: Create `.agents/` without checking for `.agent/`
- ✅ CORRECT: Run `ls -la | grep "\.agent"`, find `.agent/`, analyze content, consolidate

**Violations**: Creating duplicate folders is a violation requiring immediate fix.
```

## Common Review Scenarios

### Scenario 1: CLAUDE.md Modified (with MCP)

**Complete workflow using MCP servers**:

```
Step 1: Identify changes
"Show git diff for CLAUDE.md"

Step 2: Systematic review using Sequential Thinking MCP
"Use sequential thinking to review CLAUDE.md changes:
1. List all sections modified
2. Check each section for internal contradictions
3. Cross-reference with other CLAUDE.md sections
4. Verify all examples match stated rules
5. Check for ambiguous instructions
6. Assess integration with existing structure
7. Identify CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR issues"

Step 3: Create review report
# Document findings in .agents/outputs/reviews/2025-11-01-claude-md-review.md

Step 4: Create issues for CRITICAL/MAJOR findings using GitHub MCP
"Create GitHub issue:
- Title: bug(CLAUDE.md): Section X contradicts Section Y
- Labels: type:bug,priority:critical,agent:review,severity:critical
- Body: [detailed description from review report]
"

Step 5: Report to user
"Review complete. Found 2 CRITICAL, 1 MAJOR issues.
Full report: .agents/outputs/reviews/2025-11-01-claude-md-review.md
Issues created: #47, #48"
```

**Fallback (without MCP)**:
```bash
# 1. Check what changed
git diff CLAUDE.md

# 2. Review changed sections manually
# - Check for contradictions
# - Verify examples match rules
# - Check formatting

# 3. Create review report
vim .agents/outputs/reviews/2025-10-31-claude-md-review.md

# 4. If issues found, create GitHub issues via Issue Manager
```

### Scenario 2: New Script Created

```bash
# 1. Check structure
ls -R scripts/dev/github/

# 2. Verify subfolder + README
test -f scripts/dev/github/new-script/new-script.ps1 || echo "❌ Not in subfolder"
test -f scripts/dev/github/new-script/README.md || echo "❌ Missing README"

# 3. Check script header
head -20 scripts/dev/github/new-script/new-script.ps1 | grep "Purpose:"

# 4. Check category README updated
grep "new-script" scripts/dev/github/README.md

# 5. Create review report with findings
```

### Scenario 3: Major Feature PR (with MCP)

**Complete workflow using MCP servers**:

```
Step 1: Verify spec and implementation
"Check if docs/architecture/feature-name-spec.md exists"
"Review spec requirements vs implemented code"

Step 2: Check code attribution
"Search for 'Adapted from' in src/ to verify vendor attribution"

Step 3: Verify best practices using Context7 MCP
"Use context7 to verify this FastAPI endpoint follows current best practices:
[paste code snippet]"

"Use context7 to check if this SQLAlchemy async query uses 2.0 syntax:
[paste code snippet]"

Step 4: Security review
"Search for hardcoded credentials in src/"
"Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries"
"Verify input validation on all API endpoints"

Step 5: Run tests
"Execute: pytest tests/ --cov"

Step 6: Create comprehensive review report
# Document in .agents/outputs/reviews/2025-11-01-feature-name-review.md

Step 7: Create issues for findings using GitHub MCP
"Create GitHub issue for each CRITICAL/MAJOR finding"
```

**Fallback (without MCP)**:
```bash
# 1. Review spec exists
test -f docs/architecture/feature-name-spec.md || echo "⚠️  No spec found"

# 2. Check code attribution
grep -r "Adapted from" src/ | grep "vendor/"

# 3. Run tests
pytest tests/ --cov

# 4. Review security
grep -r "password" src/ | grep -v "hashed"
grep -r "SQL" src/ | grep "execute"

# 5. Create comprehensive review report
```

---

## Communication with Other Agents

### Requesting Issue Creation

**Write to**: `.agents/workspace/issue-manager/create-issue-request.txt`

**Format**:
```
Create issue for Review Coordinator finding:

Title: <type>(<component>): <description>
Labels: type:X,priority:X,agent:review,severity:X
Milestone: Week N
Body:
<detailed description>

See review report: .agents/outputs/reviews/<filename>
```

### Handing Off to Design/Coding

After finding issues that need implementation:

1. Create issues via Issue Manager
2. Mention in review report which agent should handle
3. Leave context in issue body

---

## Success Criteria

**You succeed when**:
- ✅ No contradictory documentation gets committed
- ✅ All scripts follow folder structure rules
- ✅ Security issues are caught before merge
- ✅ Review reports are actionable (clear fixes)
- ✅ CRITICAL issues always result in GitHub issues

---

**Read root CLAUDE.md for global rules. This file contains Review Coordinator-specific instructions only.**
