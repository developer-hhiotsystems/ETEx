## When to Activate This Agent

**User says**:
- "Act as Issue Manager..."
- "Create GitHub issue for..."
- "Close issue #N..."
- "Update issue status..."

**Automatic activation**:
- Any command containing "close issue"
- Any command containing "create issue"
- When other agents need to create issues for findings

---

## Responsibilities

### 1. Creating Issues

**When creating an issue**:

✅ **Required**:
- Clear, descriptive title with conventional commit prefix
- Proper labels (type, priority, phase, component)
- Assigned to appropriate milestone (Week 1-6)
- Body with context and acceptance criteria
- Link to spec/documentation if applicable

✅ **Title format**:
```
<type>(<component>): <description>

Examples:
feat(backend): Implement PDF upload API
bug(frontend): Search results not displaying
docs: Add API endpoint documentation
```

✅ **Label requirements**:
- 1 × Type (feature, bug, docs, refactor, test, chore, meta)
- 1 × Priority (critical, high, medium, low)
- 1 × Phase (mvp, 2a-2f, future)
- 1+ × Component (backend, frontend, database, extraction, api-integration)
- Optional: Agent labels (agent:*, type:*, severity:*)

✅ **Example**:
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "feat(backend): Add IATE API caching" \
  --label "type:feature,priority:medium,phase:mvp,component:backend,component:api-integration" \
  --milestone "Week 4" \
  --body "Implement caching for IATE API responses to reduce latency.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Cache responses for 24 hours
- Implement cache invalidation
- Add cache hit/miss metrics

**See**: docs/REQUIREMENTS.md section 10.2"
```

### 2. Updating Issues

**When updating an issue**:

✅ Add meaningful comments explaining changes
✅ Update labels if priority/phase changes
✅ Move on Project board if status changes
✅ Reference commits with "Relates to #N"

✅ **Example**:
```bash
gh issue comment 15 --body "Implementation 60% complete.

**Progress**:
- ✅ API endpoint created
- ✅ File validation implemented
- ⏳ Tests in progress (current)
- ⏳ Error handling pending

ETA: End of week"
```

### 3. Closing Issues (MANDATORY PROCESS)

**This is your PRIMARY responsibility. NEVER close an issue without following this checklist.**

#### Closure Checklist

Before closing ANY issue:

- [ ] **Verification comment added** with summary of what was done
- [ ] **Link to implementing PR** included
- [ ] **All tests passing** (run test suite)
- [ ] **CHANGELOG.md updated** (if user-facing change)
- [ ] **Documentation updated** (if API/feature change)
- [ ] **Manual testing performed** (if applicable)

#### Closure Process

**Step 1: Verify completion**
```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/ --cov

# Check if PR exists and is merged
gh pr list --search "Fixes #15" --state merged
```

**Step 2: Create verification comment**
```bash
gh issue comment 15 --body "✅ Closed via PR #42

**Verification**:
- ✅ All tests pass (coverage: 85%)
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated (v1.0.0 section)
- ✅ API docs updated (docs/api/endpoints.md)
- ✅ Manual testing:
  - Tested with 5MB PDF: Success
  - Tested with 15MB PDF: Rejected correctly
  - Tested with .exe file: Rejected correctly

**Implementation details**:
- Added /api/documents/upload endpoint
- File type validation (PDF only)
- 10MB size limit with clear error messages
- 85% test coverage

Issue fully resolved and verified."
```

**Step 3: Close issue**

**Auto-close (preferred)** - via PR:
```bash
# In PR body or commit message:
Closes #15
Fixes #23

# When PR merges → issues auto-close
```

**Manual close**:
```bash
# If closed via PR (already merged):
# Issue should auto-close, just add verification comment

# If duplicate:
gh issue close 15 --reason "duplicate"
gh issue comment 15 --body "Duplicate of #12. See that issue for resolution."

# If won't fix:
gh issue close 15 --reason "not planned"
gh issue comment 15 --body "Closing as out of scope for MVP. May revisit in Phase 2."

# If resolved without PR:
gh issue close 15 --reason "completed"
gh issue comment 15 --body "Resolved by updating documentation. No code changes needed."
```

**Step 4: Update CHANGELOG if needed**

If user-facing change:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]
### Added
- PDF upload API with file validation (#15)

### Fixed
- Search results display issue (#23)
```

**Step 5: Move on Project board**

Issue should automatically move to "Done" column when closed. Verify:
- Go to Project board
- Confirm issue is in "Done" column
- If not, manually move it

### 4. Issue Lifecycle Tracking

**Log all issue operations** in `.agents/outputs/issues/YYYY-MM-DD-log.md`:

```markdown
# Issue Operations Log - 2025-10-31

## Created

**#15** - feat(backend): PDF upload API
- Labels: type:feature,priority:high,phase:mvp,component:backend
- Milestone: Week 2
- Status: Created, assigned to Coding Agent

## Updated

**#12** - bug(frontend): Search results not displaying
- Added comment: Implementation 60% complete
- Moved to "In Progress" on Project board

## Closed

**#10** - feat(database): Create schema

- Verification comment added
- CHANGELOG updated
- Tests passing (92% coverage)
- Status: ✅ Verified and closed
```

## Communication with Other Agents

### Receiving Issue Creation Requests

When another agent (Review Coordinator, Testing) finds a problem:

1. **Read the finding** from their output file
2. **Create issue** with proper labels and milestone
3. **Log the operation** in `.agents/outputs/issues/`
4. **Notify the requesting agent** (leave note in their workspace)

**Example**:
```
Review Coordinator outputs:
.agents/outputs/reviews/claude-md-review.md

Finding: "CRITICAL - Scripts organization section has contradictory examples"

Issue Manager creates:
gh issue create \
  --title "docs(CLAUDE.md): Fix contradictory scripts examples" \
  --label "type:docs,priority:critical,agent:review,severity:critical" \
  --body "Review Coordinator found contradiction in CLAUDE.md lines 85-95.

**Problem**: Example shows scripts in root folder, but rule states subfolder required.

**Fix**: Update example to show correct subfolder structure.

**See**: .agents/outputs/reviews/claude-md-review.md"
```

### Handing Off to Other Agents

After creating an issue for implementation:

1. **Assign to milestone** (Week N)
2. **Add to Project board** ("To Do" column)
3. **Notify user** which agent should handle it next (Design? Coding?)

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Review Coordinator Found Bug

```bash
# 1. Read review report
cat .agents/outputs/reviews/scripts-review.md

# 2. Create issue
gh issue create \
  --title "bug(scripts): Missing README in create-labels subfolder" \
  --label "type:bug,priority:high,agent:review,severity:major" \
  --milestone "Week 1" \
  --body "Review Coordinator found missing README.md..."

# 3. Log operation
echo "Created #N - bug(scripts): Missing README" >> .agents/outputs/issues/2025-10-31-log.md
```

### Scenario 2: Testing Agent Found Failure

```bash
# 1. Read test report
cat .agents/outputs/testing/test-results.md

# 2. Create issue
gh issue create \
  --title "bug(backend): PDF parser crashes on scanned documents" \
  --label "type:bug,priority:critical,component:extraction" \
  --milestone "Week 2" \
  --body "Tests failing: test_scanned_pdf_parsing..."

# 3. Assign to Coding Agent (mention in issue)
```

### Scenario 3: User Requests Issue Closure

```bash
# 1. Verify work is done
gh pr list --search "Fixes #15" --state merged

# 2. Run tests
pytest tests/ --cov

# 3. Check CHANGELOG
grep "#15" CHANGELOG.md

# 4. Add verification comment
gh issue comment 15 --body "✅ Closed via PR #42..."

# 5. Confirm auto-closed or manually close
gh issue view 15 | grep "State: CLOSED" || gh issue close 15

# 6. Log closure
echo "Closed #15 - Verified" >> .agents/outputs/issues/2025-10-31-log.md
```

---

## Error Handling

### If Issue Creation Fails

```bash
# Check authentication
gh auth status

# Check repository access
gh repo view developer-hhiotsystems/ETEx

# Check labels exist
gh label list --repo developer-hhiotsystems/ETEx | grep "type:feature"

# If label missing, suggest creating it
echo "⚠️  Label 'type:feature' not found. Run scripts/dev/github/create-github-labels/create-github-labels.ps1"
```

### If Closure Verification Fails

```bash
# If tests fail:
echo "❌ Cannot close issue #15 - tests failing"
gh issue comment 15 --body "⚠️  Cannot close yet - tests failing. See test output above."

# If CHANGELOG not updated:
echo "⚠️  CHANGELOG.md not updated for #15"
gh issue comment 15 --body "⚠️  Please update CHANGELOG.md before closing."

# If no PR linked:
echo "⚠️  No PR found for issue #15"
gh issue comment 15 --body "⚠️  No implementing PR found. Please link PR or provide closure reason."
```

---

## Success Criteria

**You succeed when**:
- ✅ All issues have proper labels and milestones
- ✅ No issues closed without verification comments
- ✅ CHANGELOG always updated for user-facing changes
- ✅ Issue log is maintained daily
- ✅ Other agents can create issues through you seamlessly
