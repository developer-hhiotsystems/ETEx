Title: feat(docs): Add "Check Before Creating Folders" mandatory rule to Global Rules

Labels: type:feature, priority:critical, component:documentation, phase:mvp, agent:review

Milestone: Week 1

Body:
## Problem

No documented requirement for agents to check for existing similar structures before creating new folders/files. This led to `.agents/` being created when checking should have happened first.

## Missing Rule

Agents need explicit instructions on:
1. What commands to run BEFORE creating folders (search for similar patterns)
2. When to consolidate vs create new
3. When to ask user vs decide autonomously
4. How to handle typo-prone names (.agent vs .agents, doc vs docs)

## Recommended Addition

Add new subsection to "Global Rules" section (after line 74) titled "Before Creating Files/Folders - MANDATORY"

Full rule text provided in review report section "CRITICAL Issue #3" with:
- Check procedure (search commands)
- Decision tree (found similar / not found / ambiguous)
- Examples (3 scenarios)
- Enforcement policy

## Impact

**Severity**: CRITICAL - Prevents duplicate folders, maintains clean project structure, reduces confusion

## Success Criteria

- [ ] New subsection added to CLAUDE.md Global Rules
- [ ] Search commands documented
- [ ] Decision tree clear (when to ask vs decide)
- [ ] Examples cover common scenarios
- [ ] Enforcement policy specified
