Title: bug(docs): Path inconsistency .agent/ vs .agents/ throughout CLAUDE.md

Labels: type:bug, priority:critical, component:documentation, severity:critical, agent:review

Milestone: Week 1

Body:
## Problem

CLAUDE.md references `.agent/workspace/` and `.agent/outputs/` in 12+ locations, but the actual folder created is `.agents/` (with 's'). This causes:

- Agents looking in wrong location for files
- Potential creation of duplicate folders
- Broken example workflows
- File handoffs between agents failing

## Locations

- CLAUDE.md lines 72-73, 266, 278, 315, 352, 672, 674, 817-821, 837, 844-847, 1234

## Current State

```bash
ls -la | grep agent
# Shows: .agents/ (folder exists)

# But documentation says (line 72-73):
- **Agent workspace**: `.agent/workspace/`
- **Agent outputs**: `.agent/outputs/`
```

## Recommended Fix

**Option A** (Preferred): Rename `.agents/` â†’ `.agent/` to match documentation
**Option B**: Update all 12+ documentation references to `.agents/`

## Impact

**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks agent workflows and causes file system confusion
