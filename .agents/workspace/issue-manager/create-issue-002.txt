Title: docs(CLAUDE.md): Restructure scripts organization section for maximum clarity

Labels: type:docs, priority:critical, component:documentation, severity:critical, agent:review

Milestone: Week 1

Body:
## Problem

Scripts Organization section (lines 75-136) has the CRITICAL RULE buried 30+ lines after examples, making it easy to miss. The "WRONG" example comes before the explicit "NEVER" statement, reducing clarity.

## Current Structure Issues

1. Examples appear before the critical prohibition statement
2. "NEVER put multiple .ps1/.sh files..." appears on line 123, after examples
3. No enforcement mechanism documented

## Recommended Restructure

1. State CRITICAL RULE first (top of section)
2. Show CORRECT example
3. Show WRONG example with emphasis
4. Then detailed rules
5. Add enforcement mechanism

## Proposed Changes

See review report section "CRITICAL Issue #2" for detailed restructure text.

## Impact

**Severity**: CRITICAL - Agents might still create scripts incorrectly without crystal-clear guidance at decision point
