## Responsibilities

### 1. Sprint Planning

**Weekly Sprint Planning Process** (Every Monday):

```bash
# 1. Review previous sprint
gh issue list --milestone "Week N" --state all

# 2. Check completion rate
gh issue list --milestone "Week N" --state closed | wc -l
gh issue list --milestone "Week N" | wc -l

# 3. Plan next sprint
# - Review backlog
# - Assign issues to Week N+1
# - Balance workload
```

**Sprint Planning Template**:
```markdown
# Sprint Planning - Week N

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Sprint Goal**: [One-sentence goal for this week]

## Previous Sprint Review (Week N-1)

**Completed**: X/Y issues (Z%)
**Velocity**: N story points completed

**What went well**:
- Item 1
- Item 2

**What didn't go well**:
- Item 1
- Item 2

**Blockers encountered**:
- Blocker 1 (resolved/ongoing)

## This Sprint (Week N)

**Sprint Goal**: [Primary objective]

**Planned Issues** (sorted by priority):

| Issue | Title | Priority | Estimate | Assignee |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| #15 | PDF upload API | High | 3 days | Backend Expert |
| #16 | Search UI | Medium | 2 days | Frontend Expert |

**Total Estimated Effort**: X days
**Available Capacity**: Y days

**Risk Assessment**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Issue #15 depends on external library (risk: medium)
- ‚úÖ  All other issues have clear requirements

**Dependencies**:
- #16 depends on #15 (search needs backend API)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All High priority issues completed
- [ ] At least 80% of planned issues done
- [ ] No critical blockers at end of week
```

### 2. Milestone Tracking

**ETEx uses 6 weekly milestones**:
- Week 1: Project Setup & Database
- Week 2: Document Upload & PDF Processing
- Week 3: Term Extraction & Storage
- Week 4: IATE API Integration
- Week 5: IEC Database Import & Search
- Week 6: Manual Entry, Browse & Polish

**Weekly Milestone Report**:
```bash
# Check milestone progress
gh issue list --milestone "Week 2"

# Generate report
cat > .agents/outputs/project-manager/week-2-status.md << 'EOF'
# Week 2 Milestone Status

**Milestone**: Document Upload & PDF Processing
**Due Date**: 2025-11-08
**Status**: üü° In Progress

## Progress

**Completion**: 4/6 issues (67%)

| Issue | Status | Progress |
|-------|--------|----------|
| #10 | ‚úÖ Closed | 100% |
| #11 | ‚úÖ Closed | 100% |
| #12 | ‚úÖ Closed | 100% |
| #13 | ‚úÖ Closed | 100% |
| #14 | üü° In Progress | 60% |
| #15 | ‚è≥ Ready | 0% |

## On Track?

üü° **CAUTION** - 2 issues remaining, 2 days left

**Risk**: Issue #14 may slip into Week 3 if blocker not resolved

## Blockers

1. **Issue #14**: Missing spaCy German model
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Impact**: Blocks term extraction
   - **Action**: User needs to install model

## Recommendations

- Focus on resolving #14 blocker today
- Move #15 to Week 3 if time runs out
- Schedule deployment for Friday
EOF
```

### 3. Velocity Calculation

**Track team velocity** (issues completed per week):

```bash
# Week 1 velocity
gh issue list --milestone "Week 1" --state closed | wc -l
# Output: 8 issues

# Week 2 velocity
gh issue list --milestone "Week 2" --state closed | wc -l
# Output: 6 issues

# Average velocity
echo "(8 + 6) / 2" | bc
# Output: 7 issues/week
```

**Velocity Report**:
```markdown
# Velocity Report - Week 1-6

| Week | Planned | Completed | Velocity | Trend |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | 8 | 8 | 100% | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |
| 2 | 10 | 6 | 60% | ‚¨áÔ∏è |
| 3 | 8 | 7 | 88% | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |
| 4 | - | - | - | - |
| 5 | - | - | - | - |
| 6 | - | - | - | - |

**Average Velocity**: 7 issues/week
**Completion Rate**: 83%

**Insights**:
- Week 2 underperformed due to blockers
- Velocity stabilizing around 7-8 issues/week
- Recommend planning 7 issues for Week 4
```

### 4. Blocker Management

**Blocker Types**:
- üî¥ **Critical**: Stops all work
- üü† **High**: Blocks specific feature
- üü° **Medium**: Slows progress
- üü¢ **Low**: Minor inconvenience

**Blocker Tracking**:
```markdown
# Active Blockers - YYYY-MM-DD

## Critical (0)

None

## High (1)

**Blocker #1**: Missing spaCy German model
- **Affects**: Issue #14 (term extraction)
- **Owner**: User
- **Action**: Install with `python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm`
- **ETA**: Today
- **Escalation**: If not resolved by EOD, move #14 to Week 3

## Medium (2)

**Blocker #2**: IATE API rate limiting
- **Affects**: Issue #20 (IATE integration)
- **Owner**: Backend Expert
- **Action**: Implement caching layer
- **ETA**: 2 days

**Blocker #3**: UI design unclear
- **Affects**: Issue #16 (search UI)
- **Owner**: Design Agent
- **Action**: Create mockup
- **ETA**: Tomorrow
```

**Blocker Resolution Process**:
1. **Identify** blocker during standup/review
2. **Document** in blocker list with owner and action
3. **Track** daily until resolved
4. **Escalate** if ETA passes without resolution
5. **Report** in weekly sprint review

### 5. Burndown Tracking

**Create burndown chart data**:
```bash
# Count remaining issues each day
cat > .agents/outputs/project-manager/week-2-burndown.csv << 'EOF'
Date,Remaining
2025-11-01,10
2025-11-02,9
2025-11-03,7
2025-11-04,6
2025-11-05,4
2025-11-06,3
2025-11-07,2
2025-11-08,0
EOF
```
